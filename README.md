### My process

I still have a lot to learn, especially in javascript, i need to make my code look more readable, and i will study how to use arrow function etc... overall i have fun making this project, i started this project last month, but then i got busy in school, so i just finished it now.My javascsript code here is so messy, anyways I'll try to do better next time... If you have some suggestions for me to improve how i write code feel free to share with me.

### What I learned

What i learned while, building this, is that functions in javascript are important, it helps make the code look cleaner, and organize, in css i learned how to make the images more responsive. I learned alot while making this,and i'll try to learn and study more.
